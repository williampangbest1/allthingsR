<h3>Introduction and Some Basics</h3>
<p>This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of R functions and some
of its basic properties. However, to ensure everyone is brought up to
speed, I will mix in a review of some basic concepts in this workshop.
If you are struggling to follow this material, I highly suggest
reviewing the <a
href="https://marx.library.yale.edu/data-gis-statlab/statlab/workshops/statistical-support-workshop-materials">“First
Steps with R”</a> tutorial that can be found on the <a
href="https://marx.library.yale.edu/data-gis-statlab/statlab">StatLab</a>
website.</p>
<p>To assign a variable in R, we use the leftward operator
<code>&lt;-</code>, which is unlike most other languages that utilizes
<code>=</code>. Let’s try assigning a variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- 3
b &lt;- 15

a + b # Finding the sum of a and b</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 18</code></pre>
<p>Here we have created two objects in R — the variable <code>a</code>
and <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>Another way to do this is to create a vector containing
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and use the <code>sum</code> function
to add everything in the newly created vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vectorSum &lt;- c(a,b)

# Utilizing the sum function
sum(vectorSum)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 18</code></pre>
<p>If you’re using R studio, you can find the objects stored in the
environment tab on the right hand corner of your screen. Another way to
check that the object is created is to type <code>a</code> (if you’re
familiar with linux operating systems, you can also use the
<code>ls()</code> function to list the “working directory” of
variables).</p>
<p>Another point that I want to illustrate here is the use of comments.
You can do so by adding a <code>#</code> to hide out the content that
you don’t want the computer to “read”. It’s always good practice to
comment your code, as it helps you remember what’s going on and helps
whoever that wants to replicate your code.</p>
<p>On to packages!</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-and-loading-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing and Loading Packages</h3>
<p>You might have heard or already used packages such as
<code>tidyverse</code>, <code>dplyr</code>, and other packages that
pertain to the statistical analysis that you’re doing. As a quick
refresher, packages — which are essentially a set of functions (think of
it as buying kitchen appliances) — needs to first be installed on your
local machine. To do so, you can utilize the
<code>install.packages</code> function.</p>
<p>For this example, we would like to install the <code>tidyverse</code>
and <code>dplyr</code> in one line. Recall that we can use the combine
argument, <code>c("packageOne", "packageTwo")</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;,&quot;dplyr&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>If this is your first time installing the package onto your local
machine, you should see a bunch of red text followed by the word
<em>downloaded: size of file</em>.</p>
<p>Every time you use a new R session/R file, you need to load packages
using the function . This is akin to saying that I bought a food
processor in my apartment (i.e., installing the package) and that I will
be using the food processor for my recipe (i.e., loading the
packages).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

# Alternatively, you could do this:
packages &lt;- c(&quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;)
lapply (packages, require, character.only = TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="reading-in-data-files" class="section level3">
<h3>Reading in Data Files</h3>
<p>If you’re here, I’m assuming that your favorite function is
<code>read.csv</code>. However, <code>read.csv</code> might not be the
best practice if you’re reading in data from other sources, especially
data that contains dates which can become very messy in the long run.
It’s good practice to know the classes of your data before tooling
around with it — knowing your data types early can prevent a lot of
potential headaches down the line.</p>
<p>To “force” variable classes in the different variables in your
dataset, we use the <code>read_csv</code> command (as opposed to the
read.csv command) that is part of the <code>tidyverse</code> package.
Today, we’ll be working with a fun Pokemon dataset that is available on
<a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeithGalli/pandas/master/pokemon_data.csv">Github</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon &lt;- read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeithGalli/pandas/master/pokemon_data.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 800 Columns: 12
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot;
## chr (3): Name, Type 1, Type 2
## dbl (8): #, HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed, Generation
## lgl (1): Legendary
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.</code></pre>
<p>Before working with the dataset, I just wanted to quiz folks here.
Since we’re using the <code>read_csv</code> function, this means that we
must be reading a <code>csv file</code>. But how do I know that this is
a <code>csv</code> file? Let’s take a quick look at the <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeithGalli/pandas/master/pokemon_data.csv">raw
file</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, all the information is separated by <em>commas</em>,
hence the name Comma-Separated Values, or csv.</p>
<p>Great, if you now look at your console, you can see that we’re given
information about the classes of the dataset. It’s always great to do a
quick scan of this to see whether anything is weird. Just for fun, I
tried using the <code>read.csv</code> function to read the pokemon
dataset, and I noticed that read.csv reads in data with numbers as an
interger type, whereas the <code>read_csv</code> reads numbers as a
numeric/double type.</p>
<p>This is not awfully important for most of your use cases (other than
the fact that integers uses less memory, which doesn’t really affect our
usecase but might be a problem when you’re working with million and
million of rows of data and data storage is expensive!). Anyway, sorry
for that small tangent, but I’m assuming some of you might work with
very large datasets in the future, so it’s always good to think about
storage and that storage costs computational time and money!</p>
<p>Okay, going back to the <code>column specification</code>, you would
notice that the <code>legendary</code> column is grouped under
<code>lgl</code>, which means logical, or a boolean type (that is, a
variable that will only give you TRUE or FALSE).</p>
<p>So why is it important that we know that this is a logical class
type? For instance, we want out how many of the 800 pokemons are
legendary.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(pokemon$Legendary)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 65</code></pre>
<p>Say that the legendary variable was of the <code>chr</code> character
class. Let’s hold this thought for now as I show you how to force the
variable class for the data you’re reading.</p>
<p>The <code>read_csv</code> allows us to force the variable class. We
don’t have to type it out all manually — the <code>spec()</code>
function automatically generates the <code>col_types</code> that we can
copy and paste.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spec(pokemon)

pokemon &lt;- read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeithGalli/pandas/master/pokemon_data.csv&#39;,
  col_types = cols(
  `#` = col_double(),
  Name = col_character(),
  `Type 1` = col_character(),
  `Type 2` = col_character(),
  HP = col_double(),
  Attack = col_double(),
  Defense = col_double(),
  `Sp. Atk` = col_double(),
  `Sp. Def` = col_double(),
  Speed = col_double(),
  Generation = col_double(),
  Legendary = col_character() # Changed from col_logical()
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s try summing up the legendary variable to find out the
number of legendary Pokemons in our Pokedex:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(pokemon$Legendary)</code></pre>
<p>As a tip, if you’re unfamiliar with the inputs of a function, it’s
always useful to consult <code>?functionName</code>. In this case, it
would be <code>?read_csv</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-first-glance-at-your-dataset" class="section level3">
<h3>A First Glance at your dataset</h3>
<p>I’m sure a lot of you know this so I’ll run through this quickly, but
as a student myself I know that it’s sometimes good to just do a quick
summary of basic functions that you can refer back to later on. Going
back to the pokemon dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(pokemon, n = 5) #Gives the first 5 rows in a dataset, or our Pokedex
tail(pokemon, n = 5) # Gives the last 5 rows in a dataset, or our Pokedex
summary(pokemon) 
# Provides a summary statistic of each variable. While it might not be too helpful to know the min or max of the Pokedex number, stats about the attack, speed, and defense could be quite useful to us. 
table(pokemon$`Type 1`) # Count the number of types in the Pokedex
prop.table(table(pokemon$`Type 1`))</code></pre>
<p>If you’re in a pinch, you can refer to this table.</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="28%" />
<col width="71%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Function Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>head( )</td>
<td>Gives the first few rows in a dataset</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>tail( )</td>
<td>Gives the last few rows in a dataset</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>summary( )</td>
<td>Provides some basic summary statistics of each variable</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>table( )</td>
<td>Counts the occurrence each variable</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>prop.table(table ( ))</td>
<td>Provides the proportion of occurrence of each variable</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>colnames( )</td>
<td>Gives us the column names of the dataset</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Okay, so we were able to get a bird’s eye view of the statistics. But
say I only wanted to analyze legendary Pokemons. How do I subset my data
in a way that only includes Legendary Pokemon?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon[pokemon$Legendary == &quot;TRUE&quot;, ]</code></pre>
<p>Okay! Now I want to know more about the dataset for just legendary
Pokemons. It would be useful to know, for instance, what their HP,
attack, and defense points are like.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> For the Pokemon fans out there, I
encourage you to play around after the workshop to compare stats between
the legendary and non-legendary Pokemons by modifiying this code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>onlyLegendary &lt;- pokemon[pokemon$Legendary == &quot;TRUE&quot;, ]
summary(onlyLegendary)</code></pre>
<p>I might also be curious to know the names of Pokemons are legendary,
or to know their numbers on the Pokedex so I can flip the physical book
faster (which I don’t think anyone does anymore, but please help me
indulge in my childhood).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>onlyLegendary$Name 
onlyLegendary$`#`</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="modifying-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Modifying Data</h3>
<p>Here we will be introducing the concept of piping, which you might
have been exposed to and is part of the <code>dplyr</code> package. The
main idea of piping is really to simplify your code – you could
theoretically do without piping, as you can see as we try and replicate
some examples from above – but the advantages of piping should be
obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> What the pipe function does is take the
output of one function and passes it into another function as an
argument</p>
<p>Let’s try doing the previous operation again, that is, to find the
summary statistics of only legendary Pokemons. First, we nede to make
sure that <code>dplyr</code> is in our library.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)

pokemon %&gt;% filter(Legendary == &quot;TRUE&quot;) %&gt;% summary()</code></pre>
<p>Here, I cheated with the <code>filter</code> function (I could have
used the filter equivalent in base R, which is <code>subset</code>), but
we’ll ignore this little fact for now. The point I’m trying to make is
that the code is way more concise (I don’t have to create a new variable
called <code>onlyLegendary</code>, or use the dollar <code>$</code>
symbol a million times) and easy to follow.</p>
<p>I’m also going to use the opportunity to rename some of the variables
in my dataset. For instance, the Pokedex number is represented with the
pound <code>#</code> sign, which can be problematic as R might read it
as a comment. I’m also going to rename some other variables while I’m at
it for convenience in coding later.</p>
<p>To do so, we can use the <code>rename</code> function, where
<code>new_variable_name = old_variable_name</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon %&gt;% rename(id = `#`, legendary = Legendary, type1 = `Type 1`, type2 = `Type 2`)</code></pre>
<p>Okay, let’s check if the variables have been renamed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ls(pokemon)</code></pre>
<p>Wait, what just happened? The changes don’t seem to be saved when I
call the <code>pokemon</code> data frame. This is because the pipe
operation in <code>dplyr</code> outputs the data in something called a
<code>tibble</code>, but does not make changes to the original dataset.
This can be incredibly useful in some contexts (for instance, you want
to demonstrate that you don’t need to touch the original dataset for
your analysis, which can be important for reproducibility), but for my
purposes — which is to make the coding life a bit easier — I would like
to permanently change my dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% rename(id = `#`, legendary = Legendary, type1 = `Type 1`, type2 = `Type 2`)</code></pre>
<p>The simple fix would be to rewrite our <code>pokemon</code> dataset
using the right arrow operator <code>&lt;-</code>. Let’s run the
<code>ls</code> function again.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ls(pokemon)</code></pre>
<p>Perfect! Remember that variable names in R are <em>case
sensitive</em> — knowing this fact and renaming your variables could
save a lot of time in trouble shooting.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s get more practice with some core <code>dplyr</code>
functions. Say I know my Pokemon stats quite well, and my guess is that
a legendary Pokémon has an HP at least greater than 92 and attack at
least greater than 116 (heh, I cheated by looking at the summary
statistics).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>powerfulPokemon &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% filter(HP &gt;= 92 &amp; Attack &gt;= 116) 
sum(powerfulPokemon$legendary)/nrow(powerfulPokemon) 
65/nrow(pokemon) # Recall that there are 65 legendary Pokemons</code></pre>
<p>So among Pokémons with an HP at least greater than 92 and attack at
least greater than 116, around 42% of them are legendary (recall that
there are about 65 legendary Pokémons in total, which is about 8% of all
Pokémons).</p>
<p>We can also filter by type. I so happen to know — with the help of
Google - that most legendary Pokémons are psychic type.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>psychicPokemon &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% filter(type1 == &quot;Psychic&quot;)
sum(psychicPokemon$legendary)/nrow(psychicPokemon)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.245614</code></pre>
<p>Around 25% of psychic Pokémons are legendary. That is pretty high -
compared to the water Pokemon (which is the most popular), where only
about 4% of water Pokémons are legendary.</p>
<p>Sweet! Another idea we might have is to be see if legendary Pokémons
have a higher overall total points. We could do this with the
<code>mutate</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% mutate(total = rowSums(.[5:10]))

# Always good practice to check if the function is doing what we want

colnames(pokemon) # Check if the total variable is created
sum(pokemon[1, 5:10]) # Sum columns 5 to 10 of row 1
pokemon$total[1] # This should equal to the new variable we created </code></pre>
<p>Notice the dot <code>.</code> in the mutate function. The
<code>.</code> function is equivalent to saying
<code>rowsums(pokemon[5:10])</code>. But isn’t this the whole point of
using the pipe operator — to avoid this hassle?</p>
<p>Recall what the pipe function does. It takes the output of the LHS
(left hand side) of the function and passes it to the RHS (right hand
side).</p>
<p>However, some functions work better at “understanding” dataframes,
while others work better at interpreting one dimensional vectors. The
sum function is used to add up everything in a one dimension vector – as
we saw in our very first example when I asked you to create a vector
adding up <code>a+b</code>. But recall that from the pipe function,
we’re feeding in a dataframe, not a specific column.</p>
<p>The take-home message here is to understand the general idea behind
what a function is doing — and leave the nuts and bolts idiosyncrasies
to Google or Stackoverflow. We will be introducing the
<code>group_by</code> function in a bit that makes life easier, but just
to finish up with the example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>onlyLegendary &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% filter(legendary == &quot;TRUE&quot;) %&gt;% {sum(.$total)}/65
notLegendary &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% filter(legendary == &quot;FALSE&quot;) %&gt;% {sum(.$total)}/(800-65)</code></pre>
<p>Again, the use of curly brackets <code>{}</code> is related to
telling the computer how to parse the data and is specific to the
function. So be careful when piping!</p>
<p>Okay, let me drop the <code>total</code> column just to make things
like it was. We can use the <code>select</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% select(-total)</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <code>-</code> sign means that we are removing a
variable. Of course, you could also do this by writing out
<code>pokemon %&gt;% select(type1, type2, HP, Attack, Defense ...)</code>,

<h3>Collapsing Data</h3>
<p>We’ve covered quite a bit of functions so far, but perhaps the most
important one in the <code>dplyr</code> package is the
<code>group_by</code> function. Okay, let’s try again to get some
summary statistics on legendary Pokémons.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon %&gt;% 
  group_by(legendary) %&gt;%
  summarize(count= n(), HP = mean(HP), Attack = mean(Attack), Defense = mean(Defense))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   legendary count    HP Attack Defense
##   &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 FALSE       735  67.2   75.7    71.6
## 2 TRUE         65  92.7  117.     99.7</code></pre>
<p>As the name suggests, the <code>group_by</code> function takes a
table, segments it, and then performs operations based on the specified
groups. It’s a bit hard to explain in words, so I hope that this diagram
from <a href="https://cengel.github.io/R-data-wrangling/">Claudia A
Engel</a> will help.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://cengel.github.io/R-data-wrangling/img/split-apply-combine.png" style = "width: 500px; height: 400px;">
</center>
<p>Let’s walk through what just happened in the above function. First,
the <code>group_by</code> function “split” the dataset into two sets, if
you will — a [735 x 12] set and a [65 x 12] dataframe. Then, we ran a
<code>n()</code> function, which counts the rows in each of the “split”
dataset. The <code>mean()</code> operation was then performed on the
split dataset to calculate the mean HP for legendary and nonlegendary
Pokémons, as well as the mean Attack points.</p>
<p>Cool! This is a really important function, because it has saved us a
lot of time and hassle!</p>
<p>We can also use <code>group_by</code> with multiple arguments, such
as grouping by the type of Pokémons and whether it’s legendary or not.
Recall from our previous hypothesis (with the help of Google) that we
think there’s something interesting going on with Psychic Pokémons.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>psychic &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% 
  group_by(type1, legendary) %&gt;%
  summarize(count= n(), HP = mean(HP), Attack = mean(Attack), Defense = mean(Defense))

# To just output Psychic Pokemons
psychic[psychic$type1 == &quot;Psychic&quot;, ]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 6
## # Groups:   type1 [1]
##   type1   legendary count    HP Attack Defense
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Psychic FALSE        43  67.7   55.0    61  
## 2 Psychic TRUE         14  79.6  122.     88.2</code></pre>
<p>Since we’re only interested in comparing legendary Psychic Pokémons
vs nonlegendary Psychic Pokémons, we could use the <code>filter</code>
function as well.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  pokemon %&gt;% 
  filter(type1 == &quot;Psychic&quot;) %&gt;%
  group_by(legendary) %&gt;%
  summarize(count= n(), HP = mean(HP), Attack = mean(Attack), Defense = mean(Defense))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   legendary count    HP Attack Defense
##   &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 FALSE        43  67.7   55.0    61  
## 2 TRUE         14  79.6  122.     88.2</code></pre>
<p>Nice! And again, if we wanted to add up all the stats and find the
mean, <code>summarize</code> is particular helpful because we can use
the <code>mean</code> function as one of its arguments (try redoing the
previous pipe,
<code>onlyLegendary &lt;- pokemon %&gt;% filter(legendary == "TRUE") %&gt;% mean(total)</code>
with <code>mean(total)</code> — spoiler, it will not work).</p>
<pre class="r"><code> pokemon %&gt;%
  mutate(total = rowSums(.[5:10])) %&gt;%
  group_by(legendary) %&gt;%
  summarize(count = n(), avg = mean(total))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 3
##   legendary count   avg
##   &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 FALSE       735  417.
## 2 TRUE         65  637.</code></pre>

<div id="joining-tables" class="section level3">
<h3>Joining Tables</h3>
<p>Before we end the tutorial, I want to leave you with one last skill —
which is to join two tables together! Let us split the table right in
the middle (i.e., columns 1-6 on one dataframe, and columns 7-12 on
another), which you should all be able to do by now.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon_left &lt;- pokemon[, 1:6]
pokemon_right &lt;- pokemon[, 7:12]</code></pre>
<p>Great. Now the left side of the table (i.e., the side containing
column 1) also has the variable <code>id</code> in it. Let’s create an
artificial <code>num</code> variable (which corresponds to the Pokemon
ID) for the right column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Creating a new column called id for Pokemon_right
pokemon_right$num = 1:nrow(pokemon_right)

# Rearrange columns so that ID is on the first column 
pokemon_right &lt;- pokemon_right[, c(7,1:6)] # Equivalent to saying c(7,1,2,3,4,5,6)
head(pokemon_right, n= 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 7
##     num Defense `Sp. Atk` `Sp. Def` Speed Generation legendary
##   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;    
## 1     1      49        65        65    45          1 FALSE    
## 2     2      63        80        80    60          1 FALSE</code></pre>
<p>We will call on the <code>merge</code> function — which is equvialent
to a left_join in the database langauge SQL. Here’s a diagram of what a
merge/left_join looks like:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://www.sqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SQL-LEFT-JOIN.png" style = "width: 500px; height: 200px;">
</center>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon_merge &lt;- merge(pokemon_left, pokemon_right, by.x = &quot;id&quot;, by.y = &quot;num&quot;)
# x represents the &#39;left&#39; dataset, y represents the &#39;right&#39; dataset</code></pre>
<p>Just as another quick practice, we can use create a new dataframe
with just the total score, and add in the Pokemon number (which we call
<code>num</code>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon_total = pokemon %&gt;%
  mutate(total = rowSums(.[5:10])) %&gt;%
  select(total) %&gt;%
  mutate(num = 1:800)</code></pre>
<p>To spice things up, let’s remove three rows from the dataset and then
merge with the <code>pokemon</code> dataframe.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon_total &lt;- pokemon_total[-c(1,2,3), ]

# Always good to check if a function was executed properly
dim(pokemon_total)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 797   2</code></pre>
<p>So the first three rows are missing, which means that the dimensions
of the left table and the right table are not the same. Well, it could
be one of two scenarios. The first scenario is that the after merging,
rows that are missing from the <code>pokemon_total</code> dataset is
also removed from the <code>pokemon</code> dataset (i.e., the final
number of rows will be equal to <code>pokemon_total</code>). The second
possibility is that the rows that are missing from
<code>pokemon_total</code> are marked as <code>NA</code> when merged
with the <code>pokemon</code> dataset (i.e., the final number of rows
will be equal to <code>pokemon</code>)</p>
<p>We can execute scenario 1 by setting the <code>all.x</code> argument
as FALSE, and execute scenario 2 by setting <code>all.x</code> as
TRUE.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon_merge_total_1 &lt;- merge(pokemon, pokemon_total, by.x = &quot;id&quot;, by.y = &quot;num&quot;, all.x = FALSE)

dim(pokemon_merge_total_1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 796  13</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>pokemon_merge_total_2 &lt;- merge(pokemon, pokemon_total, by.x = &quot;id&quot;, by.y = &quot;num&quot;, all.x = TRUE)

dim(pokemon_merge_total_2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 800  13</code></pre>
